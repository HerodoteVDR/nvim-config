# My first nvim configuration ðŸ›¼ and discovery of the environment

### This configuration is inspired from all the 0 to IDE tutorials on youtube, mainly from,<a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen" target="_blank">ThePrimeagen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/josean-dev" target="_blank">Josean Martinez</a>. 

So it's a very first step into discovering/configuring/learning and I look forward to continue in this direction (as my free Jetbrains license just exired and I like free stuffs ðŸ’¸)
